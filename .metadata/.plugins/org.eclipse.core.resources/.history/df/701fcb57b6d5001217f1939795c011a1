 * ErrorFSM
 *
 * ErrorFSM handles errors that can take place on the Festo system.
 * It reacts on messages by the ISRHandler (stop, estop), the pucks
 * and RS232.
 * It has its own channel where it is receiving pulse messages sent by
 * ISRHandler, pucks or the RS232. Reply is sent using a special reply
 * channel on which the pucks can listen to.
